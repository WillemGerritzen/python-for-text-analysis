    "* The other students, i.e., who follow the Master version of  course, which is Programming in Python for Text Analysis (L_AAMPLIN021), are required to **do Exercises 3 and 4 of Assignment 3b**\n",

    "If you have **questions** about this topic, please contact us **(cltl.python.course@gmail.com)**. Questions and answers will be collected on Piazza, so please check if your question has already been answered first.\n",

    "* Chapter 12 - Importing external modules\n",
    "* Chapter 13 - Working with Python scripts\n",
    "* Chapter 14 - Reading and writing text files\n",
    "* Chapter 15 - Off to analyzing text\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you will first complete a number of small exercises about each chapter to make sure you are familiar with the most important concepts. In the second part of the assignment, you will apply your newly acquired skills to write your very own text processing program (ASSIGNMENT-3b) :-). But don't worry, there will be instructions and hints along the way.\n",

    "\n",
    "Use your editor to create a Python script called **count_words.py**. Place the function definition of the **count** function in **count_words.py**. Also put a function call of the **count** function in this file to test it. Place your helper function definition, i.e., **preprocess**, in a separate script called **utils_3a.py**.
